	<h1 class="pgtitle">About Me</h1>
	<h3>My name is Anabia Iqbal and I am a grade 11 at T. L. Kennedy Secondary School.</h3>

  	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
  	<p>I enjoy and am interested in a lot of things. My favourite sports are soccer and basketball, though I always sprain my fingers or twist my ankle when I play them. Reading books and playing card games, like speed, with my sister are also things I do to pass time.

	<h2>Tech Skills?</h2>
	<p>I do not have much prior programming or tech experience, which is why I took ICS3U this semester; to try something new. I was never interested in coding and always thought that it wasn't for me.<br>My brother, who is at UTM for Computer Science, pushed me to take this course. He yelled at me all summer constantly talking about the importance of programming. Anyways, with the increasing importance of technology, even a basic understanding computer programming is a great skill that can come in handy even if I don't pursue a career in computer science.</p>
		<p><strong>So, I took ICS3U this semester. So far, I have enjoyed learning HTML and CSS!</strong></p>
